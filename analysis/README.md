This directory will contain any jupyter notebook/python files used to analyze the data.
### Descriptions of Files
## initial_clean.py
- Imports the Dataset from a local csv file
- Removes any unnecesary information, like columns and results from Independent and Green party candidates

### EDA
## First Step
I shaved down the dataset and after a lot of wrangling, created a DataFrame that contains every county, and records whether it voted for the Democratic candidate in every election from 2000-2016. This isn't quite the final result, but it brings the final analysis within reach, I'll only need to create a frame that defines whether the Democrat won in each year
## Visualizations
My project doesn't benefit from visualizations that can be realistically created by someone with limited knowledge of how to create them. I'd need a national map of the US, with every county as a point on that map to make something useful. I've included a couple visualizations in visualizations.py, and while they definitely are interesting and pertain to my topic, they're not directly applicable to my research question.
