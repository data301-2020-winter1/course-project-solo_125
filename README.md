## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

My topic focuses on the bellwether status of various US counties. Counties don't elect the president directly, but voters in a county representative of the US can serve as an early indication of where the presidential race is headed. I was interested in finding out which counties have picked the President in the past 5 elections (excluding 2020). I picked this topic before the 2020 election, so I was curious which counties to watch on election night.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

This dataset comes from the Harvard Dataverse, and was originally compiled by the MIT Election Data and Science Lab. It contains roughly 50,000 lines with every county in the US, and how many votes were cast in each for the Democratic, Republican, and Green parties, as well as a line for Independents. It also has a column with the total amount of votes cast, allowing for the calculation of the winner in each county.
